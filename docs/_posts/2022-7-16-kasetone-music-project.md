In May 2020, I decided to release my experimental and electronic music under the moniker Kasetone. This happened while being in full Covid lockdown, and is was a wise decision, as it somehow kept me sane in the head. 

My electronic music journey started some years ago when I started toying with some actual physical synths, and I haven't stopped since then. Mixing acoustic and analog/digital electronic sounds captivated me even more. It urged me to dig deeper and learn about the nature of sound itself, and how it works with and on our brains.

I decided to go with <a href="https://distrokid.com" target="_blank" alt="DistroKid">DistroKid</a> as I read good reviews about it. Also, my own comparison with other services convinced me to pick DistroKid. The tracks are released on all popular streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and YouTube Music. I also release them on my Bandcamp page, <a href="https://kasetone.bandcamp.com" target="_blank" alt="Kasetone music, Bandcamp">kasetone.bandcamp.com</a>.

### Why Kasetone?

_Kasetone_ is a word play (a mix of Estonian and English). "_Kase_" means something related to birch trees in Estonian, and "_tone_" obviously with respect to sounds. It also sounds like "_cassette one_" ... :]
